# User Story: Expose Shuttering Functionality in a Common Library

## User Story
**Title**: Expose Common Shuttering Functionality as a Shared Library

**As a** frontend developer  
**I want** to use a common shuttering (health check) functionality from a shared library  
**So that** I can maintain consistency across applications and reduce code duplication  

## Description
We currently have shuttering (health check API) functionality implemented separately in multiple React applications. This functionality needs to be:
1. Consolidated into a common library
2. Available for all applications to consume
3. Triggered automatically before every API call
4. Configurable for different endpoints and conditions

The shuttering functionality should prevent API calls when the health check fails, providing a fallback mechanism.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Library Integration**:
   - [ ] The library should be published as an npm package
   - [ ] Should support React applications (with potential for other frameworks in future)
   - [ ] Should have TypeScript support and proper type definitions

2. **Pre-API Call Behavior**:
   - [ ] Shuttering check must automatically run before every API call attempt
   - [ ] If shuttering check fails, the API call should be prevented
   - [ ] Should provide a callback/hook for UI to respond to shuttering state

3. **Configuration**:
   - [ ] Should allow configuration of health check endpoint
   - [ ] Should allow setting custom intervals for health checks
   - [ ] Should support multiple health check strategies (immediate, cached, etc.)
   - [ ] Should allow custom thresholds for failure conditions

4. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - [ ] Should provide a way to define fallback behavior when shuttering is active
   - [ ] Should support different fallback strategies per API endpoint
   - [ ] Should expose shuttering state to application for UI feedback

5. **Performance**:
   - [ ] Should not significantly impact application performance
   - [ ] Should implement caching to avoid excessive health check calls
   - [ ] Should have minimal bundle size impact

6. **Error Handling**:
   - [ ] Should properly handle network errors during health checks
   - [ ] Should provide error logging capabilities
   - [ ] Should allow custom error handlers

## Technical Notes
- The shuttering functionality should wrap existing API calls (like Axios/Fetch interceptors)
- Should work with common React state management solutions (Redux, Context, etc.)
- Should provide React hooks for easy consumption (e.g., `useShuttering()`)
- Should include documentation with examples for implementation

## Example Usage
```javascript
// Library initialization
import { initShuttering } from 'common-shuttering';

initShuttering({
  healthCheckUrl: '/api/health',
  checkInterval: 30000,
  onShutteringActive: () => {
    // Show maintenance mode UI
  }
});

// In API calls - automatically wrapped
api.get('/data').then(...).catch(...);

// React component usage
const { isShutteringActive } = useShuttering();
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this user story or provide more technical details about the implementation approach?
