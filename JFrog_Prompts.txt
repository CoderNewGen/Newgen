üß† Prompt for DeepSeek: Consuming React Utility from HMRC Artifactory

I have a React utility module that I‚Äôve published to HMRC‚Äôs private JFrog Artifactory at:  
https://artifacts.alm.gov.hmrc.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual/.

Now, I want to consume this module in other internal React projects.

‚úÖ The module is published as an npm package, for example: @hmrc/my-utils.

üîê Artifactory requires authentication using an API token.

I need help automating this in:

1. Local development setup (optional .npmrc or npm config setup)
2. CI/CD pipelines (GitLab preferred, no .npmrc in repo)
3. Example of how to use the module in a React app

Please include:
- Proper npm install commands using the private registry
- Secure handling of credentials (e.g., NODE_AUTH_TOKEN or npm config set)
- Minimal usage example of the utility in a React component
- Best practices for consuming private npm packages in enterprise environments

üß† Prompt for DeepSeek: Publishing React/Node Module to JFrog Artifactory

I have a React-based utility module that I want to publish as a private npm package to JFrog Artifactory, specifically hosted at:

https://artifacts.alm.gov.hmrc.gov.uk/artifactory/api/npm/npm-local/

This package is bundled using Webpack (v5.1.4) and includes typical React/JS code.

‚úÖ I need a complete setup and deployment strategy that includes:

1. Webpack build config
   - Output should be UMD module
   - Support for externalizing React
   - clean: true and globalObject: "this" explanation

2. Authentication for npm publish
   - Option A: .npmrc usage (for local dev only, not committed)
   - Option B: npm config set approach (for GitLab CI)
   - Option C: NODE_AUTH_TOKEN for scoped packages (if applicable)

3. GitLab CI pipeline
   - Sample .gitlab-ci.yml to build and publish package
   - Secure handling of Artifactory API key ($ARTIFACTORY_API_KEY)
   - Publish only on main or release branches

4. Best practices
   - No .npmrc in repo
   - Dynamic auth in CI/CD
   - Version tagging & changelog optional

‚úÖ Optional:
- Reference any official JFrog docs for npm publish
- HMRC-specific conventions (if known)
