## üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations

### üîπ Performance Optimizations

- **Reduce Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
  - Inline critical content
  - Avoid lazy-loading LCP images
  - Preload LCP resources (fonts, images)

- **Reduce Total Blocking Time**
  - Defer unused JS
  - Break long tasks into smaller chunks
  - Use `requestIdleCallback` or code-splitting

- **Improve First Input Delay (FID)**
  - Reduce JavaScript execution time
  - Use async/defer attributes on script tags

### üîπ Resource Optimization

- Add `<link rel="preconnect">` for external domains
- Minify and compress JS/CSS
- Remove unused code and adopt tree-shaking
- Use responsive and next-gen image formats (`<img srcset>`, WebP)
- Lazy-load offscreen images
- Use long cache TTLs for static resources
